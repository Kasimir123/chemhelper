# Python Chemistry Helper
The Python Chemistry Helper is just a little project that I will add onto every once in a while. It's purpose is to make your life easier if you are either working in the Chemistry field or if you are currently a student taking Chemistry. More features will routinely be added and hopefully one day it will be able to do the mind numbing calculations go away completely.
## Future Additions:
* Uncertainty Calculations
* Complete Periodic Table with a lot more information
* Most Chemistry Calculations...

If you would like to have a feature, please feel free to add a comment.
