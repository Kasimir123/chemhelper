# Python Chemistry Helper
The Python Chemistry Helper is meant to help people with chemistry.
## Recent Changes:
* 12/3/18 - Changed to command arguments rather than interactive dialogue. Implemented dynamic and clean command reading as well as both elements and element commands.
## To Do:
* Bring commands from helper.py to commands.json. Current issue is that functions cannot be called from .json file and read in the .py file.
* Add more features.
