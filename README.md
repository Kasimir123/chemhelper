# Python Chemistry Helper
The Python Chemistry Helper is meant to help people with chemistry.
## Recent Changes:
* 12/3/18 - Changed to command arguments rather than interactive dialogue. Implemented dynamic and clean command reading as well as both elements and element commands.
* 12/3/18 - Commands now pulled from commands.json
## To Do:
* Possibly make certain functions use interactive user input rather than only command line arguments
* mol to mass and mass to mol conversion (-m-m ELEMENT MASS/MOL MEASUREMENT)
* Coulomb's Law (-cl 1STCHARGE 2NDCHARGE DISTANCE)
* hydrogen spectrum jump to wavelength (-hydrospec 1STN 2NDN)
* Orbital Information (-oi)
* add electron config to element function
* number of unpaired electrons
* List elements with similar properties (-simprop ELEMENT)
* Add atomic radius to .json
* Compound naming - this will most likely be annoying :/
* Lewis Structures?
* How many moles of something within a compound
* number of valence electrons added to element function
* Bond Length
* Gas calculations (ideal and non ideal)
* Calculate enthalpy, entropy and free energy
* figure out why git is acting weird
